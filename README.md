### EEG Eye State Dataset
This dataset describes EEG data for an individual and whether their eyes were open or closed. The objective of the problem is to predict whether eyes are open or closed given EEG data alone.
This is a classification predictive modeling problems and there are a total of 14,980 observations and 15 input variables. The class value of ‘1’ indicates the eye-closed and ‘0’ the eye-open state. Data is ordered by time and observations were recorded over a period of 117 seconds.
